Matlab codes for my M.Sc. Dissertation Project

The codes posted are those used to obtain the different results in the project. They are organized following the same structure as the written work.

Section 3.1
- Population Dynamics to find distribution of entries of first eigenvector. *
- Code to obtain the vector A for different values of N following a single instance algorithm. *

[Section 3.2](https://github.com/LeonardoCastro/Kabashima/tree/master/Section32)
- Non-backtracking extrapolation for random regular graphs for different values of Delta.
- Non-backtracking extrapolation for random regular graphs for different values of N. *
- Non-backtracking extrapolation for Erdös-Rényi 4 networks using single instance. *
- Non-backtracking extrapolation for Erdös-Rényi 4 networls using population dynamics. *
- Population dynamics for Erdös-Rényi 4 to observe that cavity field A does not converge. *

[Appendix A](https://github.com/LeonardoCastro/Kabashima/tree/master/AppendixA)
- Code to generate random numbers following a poissonian distribution.
- Code to generate random neighbours used in population dynamics.

[Appendix B](https://github.com/LeonardoCastro/Kabashima/tree/master/AppendixB)
- Code to generate random graphs given a degree vector

[Appendix C](https://github.com/LeonardoCastro/Kabashima/tree/master/Appendix%20C)
- Code to plot Cobweb method.
- Population dynamics to obtain distribution values of A with respect to time *

(*) The repository is under construction as the codes I have written are not properly commented. I will upload them during the next few days.
